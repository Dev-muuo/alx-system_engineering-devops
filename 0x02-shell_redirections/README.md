## Introduction

In shell scripting, I/O redirections and filters are powerful tools that allow you to control the flow of data between commands, files, and streams. With I/O redirections, you can redirect input and output streams to and from files or other commands, enabling flexible data processing and manipulation. Filters, on the other hand, are commands that take input from standard input, perform specific operations on the data, and produce output to standard output.

This repository provides detailed explanations, examples, and exercises to help you understand and leverage I/O redirections and filters in your shell scripts. Whether you are a beginner looking to grasp the basics or an experienced scripter seeking advanced techniques, this repository has something for everyone.

## Usage

In this section, we'll briefly discuss the two main components of this repository: I/O redirections and filters.

### I/O Redirections

I/O redirections allow you to manipulate input and output streams in shell scripts. The most common I/O redirections include:

- `<`: Redirects input from a file to a command.
- `>`: Redirects output from a command to a file, replacing the file contents if it exists.
- `>>`: Redirects output from a command to a file, appending to the file if it exists.
- `2>`: Redirects error output from a command to a file.
- `2>&1`: Redirects both standard output and error output to a file.
- `|`: Pipes the output of one command as input to another command.

The repository provides detailed explanations and examples of each redirection technique to help you understand their usage and apply them in your scripts.

### Filters

Filters

 are commands that take input from standard input, process it, and produce output to standard output. Some commonly used filters include:

- `grep`: Searches for specific patterns in text.
- `sed`: Performs text transformations, substitutions, and editing.
- `awk`: Processes and analyzes structured text data.
- `sort`: Sorts lines of text in various ways.
- `cut`: Extracts specific columns or fields from text.
- `head`/`tail`: Outputs the first/last lines of a file or stream.

The repository provides detailed explanations, examples, and use cases for each filter command, enabling you to effectively manipulate and filter data using these tools.
